ShakeMap

ShakeMap jQuery plugin

This is a jQuery plugin for managing Google Maps from a JSON string.
The base plugin is a modified version of the original plugin jMapping, created by Brian Landau (Viget Labs - http://vigetlabs.github.com/jmapping/).
In this fork, I have changed the way the data is selected and manipulated. All the infomation about a location is retrived using AJAX and manipulated in real time by the plugin.

The plugin requires:

- MarkerClucterer - http://google-maps-utility-library-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/markerclusterer/docs/reference.html
- OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier - https://github.com/jawj/OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier

Optional requirement:

- Infobox - http://code.google.com/p/gmaps-samples-v3/source/browse/trunk/infowindow_custom/?r=37
